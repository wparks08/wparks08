### Hi there 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you'll find amongst my public repositories various Bootcamp and personal projects. Some are a bit dated, and some I've managed to work on a little bit throughout the years in spare time (I wouldn't call them 'maintained', though).

Much of my recent, professional work has been done in private repositories for the past couple of years. They're projects that I _wish_ I could show off here, but I am obligated morally (and sometimes legally) to respect client and past employer privacy.

Thanks for stopping by! 😁
